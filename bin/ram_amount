''' This script reads various system temperature sensors and puts them onto the
    command line. Needs to be started with 'sudo'.

    Problem:
        Core 2 Duo-System makes an audible and somewhat annoying sound for every
        loop, It's most probably the harddrives. Did not test on another system,
        yet.
